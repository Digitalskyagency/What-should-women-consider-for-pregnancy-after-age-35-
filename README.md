# What-should-women-consider-for-pregnancy-after-age-35-

Pregnancy after 35 carries higher risks but many women have healthy pregnancies. Key considerations: fertility declines with age (fewer & lower quality eggs), increased aneuploidy risk (higher miscarriage and chromosomal disorder rates), and elevated maternal risks (gestational diabetes, hypertension, cesarean delivery). Preconception assessment (screen for medical conditions, optimize weight, control chronic diseases), early prenatal care, and genetic counseling/testing options (like PGT-A for IVF or prenatal screening in natural conceptions) help manage risks. Lifestyle factors, timely fertility evaluation if conception is delayed, and working with an experienced obstetric and fertility team can improve outcomes. Decisions should balance risks, patient health, and reproductive goals.
